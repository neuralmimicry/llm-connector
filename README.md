![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/neuralmimicry/llm-connector/LLM-Connector)

Have conversations between multiple LLMs

With all the noise around Generative AI, it's relevant to have a system available to connect to many of them at once. This is the goal of LLM-Connector.
Why have one AI when you can have the input from many? Of course, you will need to form a consolidated answer and weed-out hallucinations, but that's the fun part.

Tuning, so that you do not need to keep setting a context for domain specific knowledge, is a goal of this project. This is parameterised so that the user can select
the area of domain knowledge at the start of the conversation.
