Have conversations between multiple L\+L\+Ms

With all the noise around Generative AI, it\textquotesingle{}s relevant to have a system available to connect to many of them at once. This is the goal of L\+L\+M-\/\+Connector. Why have one AI when you can have the input from many? Of course, you will need to form a consolidated answer and weed-\/out hallucinations, but that\textquotesingle{}s the fun part.

Tuning, so that you do not need to keep setting a context for domain specific knowledge, is a goal of this project. This is parameterised so that the user can select the area of domain knowledge at the start of the conversation.
